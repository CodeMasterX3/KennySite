	<p class="normalFont"> Welcome to KennySite... I have no idea why I called this site KennySite, but at least my website has a name. I created KennySite as a bit of a fun HTML coding project, with things like links, pictures, and maybe even videos.<br><br>The first few pages on this site will be JavaScript testbed pages, and you can find them (at least for now) at the links section on the header.</p>
